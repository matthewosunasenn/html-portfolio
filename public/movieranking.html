<h2>My top 3 Most anticipated movies of 2024</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Spider-Man Beyond the Spider-Verse</h3>
<p>While Superhero movies are becoming an increasingly generic genre, Spider-Verse has managed to stay fresh</p>
<h3>Inside Out 2</h3>
<p>Despite Pixar's recent misfires this sequel should put them back on the right track</p>
<h3>Mufasa: The Lion King</h3>
<p>The first live action Lion King was criticised for being to close to the original this sequel will have the same stunning visuals matched with a completely new story</p>
